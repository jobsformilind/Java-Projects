SOA:
An architectural pattern in computer software design in which application components provide services to other components via a communications protocol, typically over a network. 
SOA as an architecture relies on service-orientation.
The principles of service-orientation are independent of any vendor, product or technology.
A service is a self-contained unit of functionality
Services are unassociated, loosely coupled units of functionality that are self-contained.
